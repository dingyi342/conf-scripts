;; COMMENT: package management
(autoload 'package "package" "GNU Emacs lisp package management." t)

(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
			 ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
			 ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")))

;; NOTE: good point, @chu, what IS the reason for this distinction?
;; FIX: store `core-packages' and `user-packages' in an external source:
;; - a variable in `init.el' (or `config.el') and `user.el', respectively.
(defvar core-packages nil "core packages to be installed through elpa.")
(defvar user-packages nil "user packages to be installed through elpa.")
(defvar list-packages nil "packages to be installed through elpa.")

;; FIX: this will be revisited, because clearly this way sucks. but whatever works,
;; for now.
(setq core-packages (list 'diminish 'color-theme 'ido-ubiquitous)) ;; NOTE: core stuff
(setq user-packages (list 'emms 'magit))

(setq list-packages (append core-packages user-packages)) ;; NOTE: adds `core-packages' and `user-packages' together
